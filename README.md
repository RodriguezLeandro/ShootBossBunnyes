# ShootBossBunnyes
The game has a jar file playable. So you just only need to play the jar application, and it should work. Megaman-Like videogame where you have to defeat all Bosses. It is Very Difficult!

Note: Before clicking in start game, you need to make a Login in the initial game screen, or the game could crash. 

I uploaded the game to Itch.io, you van visit the page : https://leandrorodriguez.itch.io/shootbossbunnyes
